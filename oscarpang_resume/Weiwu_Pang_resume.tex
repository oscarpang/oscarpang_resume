% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Research}
\runsubsection{Open Acceleration Systems (OASYS) Research Lab}
\descript{| Undergraduate Researcher}
\location{May 2016 – Present | Los Angeles, CA}
Worked with Professor \textbf{\href{http://oasys.isi.edu/profile.php?id=1}{Young H. Cho}} to create a power management software package that is able to improve power efficiency and manufacture yield rate for modern CPUs and GPUs.
\begin{tightemize}
	\item Designed an algorithm that utilizes Longest-Common-Ancestor(LCA) to generate graphs of possible runtime execution trace of any C/C++ program.
	\item Built the software prototype using multi-threading and shared memory to actively collecting runtime information and power information.
	\item Implemented MATLAB program to extracted CPU's subcomponents' power weight.
	\item Wrote test benches to research on NVIDIA's GPU runtime scheduling detail on CUDA parallel computing platform.
	\item Utilized Mccdaq datalogger and Universal Library(UL) to developed a GPU power monitor program.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Vilesov Research Group}
\descript{| Undergraduate Researcher}
\location{Feb 2016 – Present | Los Angeles, CA}
Implemented an algorithm in MATLAB to process single-shot femtosecond X-ray coherent diffractive images. Received scholarship from USC Undergraduate Research Associates Program.
\begin{tightemize}
	\item Reconstructed and optimized old algorithm in MATLAB. The performance get 80\% better.
	\item Utilized auto-correlation technique to calculate droplet radius at different angles.
	\item Utilized lsqcurvefit and simulated annealing to process the diffraction pattern and fit the droplet model.
